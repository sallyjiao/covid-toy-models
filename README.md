# A SARS-CoV2 Model for Informing E-II Policy

We have built a mechanistic model of infectious disease dynamics to better assess how observables (e.g. secondary infections, infectious case load) are connected to "microscopic" parameters that can be controlled. The model can help answer questions like: the efficacy of different quarantine protocols, and the relative risk of SARS-CoV2 spread in E-II relative to in the greater Santa Barbara community. With more microscopic data we can also try to infer more fundamental quantities, such as the risk per unit time of close contact.

A full write-up is available here, under `E-II_SARS-CoV2_modeling_study.pdf`.
